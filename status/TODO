===============
gnome-base/gnome-2.26.0
 * Rephrase to teach about using different WMs instead, as metacity is the default anyway

 * support for it, but we don't ship with gnome-session-2.24 yet
gnome-extra/libgda-4.0.2
 * sqlite is automagic, but maybe it is a hard-dep
 * autoconf is a hell of inconsistencies
gnome-extra/libgda-4.1.0
 * sqlite is automagic, but maybe it is a hard-dep
